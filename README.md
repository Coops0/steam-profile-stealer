# Steam Profiler Stealer
This kinda sucks but it works I guess?
Running @ [anorganization.org](https://anorganization.org/)

Backend is written in Rust, originally with headless chrome but I ditched that for normal chrome requests.
Docker image is provided, and the frontend is in steam-profile-stealer lmao. Written in Vue A3 with Vuetify, and deployed for free through Vercel.
